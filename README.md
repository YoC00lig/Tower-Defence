<h1> ⭐️ Tower defence ⭐️ </h1>
<p> A simple game whose goal is to defend the castle from the incoming waves of enemies. The player can defend the castle by placing towers that deal damage to enemies and building walls that temporarily distract the
enemy from the target (castle). Unfortunately, enemies can destroy any object.</p>

<p> There are two types of towers in the game. They differ primarily in attack range and durability and therefore  in price. During the game, you can increase the tower's attack
range or sell it. Its price will of course depend on its condition - a tower that has been attacked by an enemy will no longer have its maximum value.</p>

<p> The player can also build a wall. The wall does not attack the enemy, but temporarily stops them. The enemy stands against the wall that stands in his way and destroys it until he
can go through it. This gives you extra time to think about your game strategy.</p>

<p> You can see different types of enemies. They differ in the maximum health and strength. If the tower kills an enemy, you will receive money - the amount depends on the type 
of enemy. Enemies are a bit lazy - they always look for the nearest object and choose the shortest path to it.</p>

<p> The castle is the most important object in the game. It stands in the center of the map and is the target of enemy attacks. The castle has a health
bar, and when it is empty, the game is over. You can recharge his health bar to the maximum at any time - but it's not cheap.</p>

<h2> 🗺 You can choose different variants of the map: </h2>
<p> ⚙️ Basic - you can only place towers and walls. </p>
<p> 🌊 Flood - in addition, there are inaccessible places flooded by water on the map. </p>
<p> ✨ Extended - you can increase castle health bar, sell and upgrade towers. </p>
